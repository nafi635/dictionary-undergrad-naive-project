# PersonalDictionary
#About
Most of the people will not remember english vocabulary as many as they want. They always wants to write the words on hand,notes,notepads to remember those. This project is nothing but web platform to store english words which you consider as important. Simply this is a personal dictionary where you can deploy this project and use it to store your personal vocabulary.  I developed this code as my first independent assignment this may be small to look but this is first one from my brain. It will be useful when real use of this comes to your brain.
